# MyReads Project

This is the application for the React Fundamentals course's final evaluation project on Udacity. By providing a static sample of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but without any of the React code that is required to finish the project, this template aims to save you time.
If you decide to start with this template, your task will be to restructure the static code in it in order to bring interactivity to the project.

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`


I apply the following techniques in my Reads application:

1- Axios.

2- ErrorBoundary.

3- Material UI.
